                    <h1>Legal and Professional Framework</h1>
                    <p>When auditors are brought on, they have both a legal and professional framework in which they must adhere to, of which can be viewed in Companies Act 2006 legislation. We'll explore both legal and professional from an auditor's point-of-view.</p>

                    <h2>Responsibilities and Rights of Auditors subject by Companies Act Legislation</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Duties, Rights and Responsibilities of Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Companies Act legislation goes deep into the duties and responsibilities of auditors, where the auditor must express an opinion based on finalised financial statements of companies, and they cover the following:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor's Report on Annual Accounts</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must prepare a report for the shareholders of the company, based on the annual accounts of that company. The auditor must also give their opinion as to whether the accounts give a fair and true view of the company's financial position and performance. Whether they have been prepared in accordance with Companies Act 2006, and whether they comply with the relevant financial reporting frameworks.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor's Report on Director's Report</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must express an opinion on whether the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. Ensuring that the directors’ report does not contradict the audited financial statements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Report on Strategic Report and Directors’ Report</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must state whether the strategic report and directors’ report are consistent with the financial statements. Ensuring both reports align with the audited financial data, providing shareholders with reliable information.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Duties of Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The duties of an auditor are to examine accounting records to ensure proper account records have been kept. Ensure consistency within the account and account records. Report if they have not received all necessary information for the audit. Ensure proper returns are received from branches not visited. If any of these are not met, the auditor must state this in their report.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditors’ Right to Information</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors have the right to access all books, account, and information required for the audit. Directors and officers must provide the requested information and explanations promptly. This ensures the auditor can fully investigate the company’s financial affairs without obstruction.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Rights to Attend Company Meetings</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors have the right to attend any general meetings, receive all notices and communications related to these meetings, and have the ability to speak on matters related to the audit and the financial statements. This ensures auditors can clarify and defend their findings directly to shareholders.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Statement in Case of Auditor’s Removal</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If an auditor is removed before their term ends, they can submit a statement explaining the reasons. The company must send this statement to all shareholders and notify them of its availability. This ensures transparency and allows auditors to express concerns about potential management interference.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor’s Rights in Relation to Written Resolutions</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If shareholders propose a written resolution that affects auditors (e.g., removal), auditors must receive a copy of the resolution and have the right to respond in writing. The company must circulate the auditor’s response to shareholders. This prevents unfair removal or decisions without giving auditors a change to explain their side.</p>
                    <br>

                    <h2>Independence of Auditors</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Auditor Independence</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must remain independent and unbiased in their examination of a companies financial statement, and the Companies Act 2006 legislation enforces that this remains the case.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Appointment of Auditors of Private Companies</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Private companies must appoint an auditor for each financial year unless they are exempt (e.g., small companies under audit exemption thresholds). The appointment must occur within 29-days of the companies financial year-end (if not already done at a general meeting). If a company fails to appoint an auditor, the directors have the authority to do so. This ensures private companies cannot indefinitely avoid audits, maintaining transparency and accountability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Appointment of Auditors of Public Companies</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Public companies must appoint auditors at each annual general meeting (AGM) to serve until the next AGM. Appointment also requires a majority vote by shareholders. This reinforces auditor independence by ensuring they are appointed directly by shareholders rather than management.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Term of Office for Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors hold office from the end of the meeting, at which they are appointed, until the conclusion of the next AGM (for public companies) or until an auditor is reappointed or replaced. This establishes a clear and consistent term for auditors, preventing indefinite appointments that could compromise independence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Reappointment of Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors are automatically reappointed for the next financial year, however, unless a resolution has been passed to appoint someone else or not to reappoint them, they have declined reappointment, or the company is exempt from requiring an audit. This simplifies the reappointment process while allowing shareholders to intervene if necessary.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Prevention of Automatic Reappointment</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Automatic reappointment is prevented if the auditor was appointed by the directors rather than by a resolution at a general meeting, a member of the company has notified the company of an objection to reappointment, or the auditor’s term has expired due to specific disqualification reasons (e.g., independence concerns). This safeguards against potential conflicts of interest by ensuring reappointment cannot occur automatically under certain circumstances.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Resolution to Remove Auditors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Shareholders may pass an ordinary resolution at any time to remove the auditor, regardless of their term in office. The auditor must be given notice and the opportunity to make written representations that must be sent to shareholders. This ensures that auditors can only be removed transparently and fairly, protecting their independence by allowing them to explain the circumstances to shareholders.</p>
