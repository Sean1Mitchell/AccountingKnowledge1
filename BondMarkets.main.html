                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>How does Government Debt Work?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Government borrowing is different from the debts we run up as individuals. That's because countries can riase taxes and issue their own currency, giving them ways to pay back loans.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Borrowing allows governments to spend more on public services and projects than they raise in taxes. They ofen borrow to bridge the gap between income and spending because tax rises are politically difficult, leaving citizens with less money and threatening economic growth.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Countries borrow from each other or from global organisations like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>What are Government Bonds?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Governments around the world issue bonds in order to borrow money to help pay their bills: Investors, including banks, insurers and pension funds as well as individuals, buy them in order to earn a return.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Rather than simply calling them 'UK Government Bonds', they are often referred to by nicknames or abbreviations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Don't worry about why, it's enough to know that when people talk about gilts, that's our government's debt. US bonds are called treasuries, German ones are bunds, French ones are OATs, and Japanese ones are JGBs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Governments issue bonds with a range of different maturities - 3 months, 1 year, 10 years, 30 years and more. This is the length of time governments are giving themselves to pay back investors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Short-dated bonds are those that mature fast, in normal times are deemed less risky as a result. Long-dated bonds are those where investors have to wait a while to see their money again, and are regarded as riskier because there is more time for things to go wrong.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>How Government Bonds Work</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Governments also raise money by selling bonds, often to institutional investors or pension funds. An investor buying a bond is lending the government money for an agreed term, and many bonds pay out interest at regular interbals - known as coupon payments (interest).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When the agreed term of a bond ends - known as its maturity date - the government pays back the original sum of money. Some bonds are very short-term, others last for decades.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>What are Bond Prices and Yields?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Bond prices are the cost of bonds, or what investors pay to buy the debt, and bond yields are a measure of the annual return  to investors who buy government debt. The yield is the interest rate, or coupon, that you earn for holding the bonds. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions. When prices move up, yields fall, and vice versa.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Bond Price Movement</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Which direction they are going in is basically down to the level of demand for bonds in the market at the time. When there is strong appetite for bonds, because people see them as a safe haven, for example, their prices rise and governments get away with paying less interest on their debt via lower-yields.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When there is a bond sell-off, because people think they can get a better return from stocks, for example, their prices fall and governments end up paying higher interest to attract investors via a better yield.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>What can Bond Market Moves tell us about the Future?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Financial experts watch government bond markets closely because they help explain investors' attitide to current events and risks. They might even foretell what will happen in the future - such as an economic boom or a recession.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Bond watchers do this using an important and revealing indicator called the yield curve, so it's worth learning how this works and decoding the confusing jargon surrounding it.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>What is the Yield Curve?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At it's simplest, this shows what yield you are getting for bonds with different maturities at a single point in time. Usually, the yield or interest rate will be lower on bonds with shorter maturities because it's not long until investors get their money back, so they see them as less risky and will accept a lower return. However, the yield tends to be higher on bonds with longer maturities like 10 years because there is more chance of things going wrong, so investors see them as more risky and want a better return.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>How to Invest in Government Bonds</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When a government decides they want to raise funds through government bonds, it will issue them and typically sell them through a bond auction to banks or other financial institutions. These banks and financial institutions will then sell these bonds on, usually to funds or individual investors. Buying government bonds directly from the government typically involves purchasing them directly from HM Debt Management Office or from authorised agents. Of course, individual bonds can still be purchased through the LSE the same way you would purchase shares in a company.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Instea of buying individual bonds, you could also invest in them through funds. These are typically in the form of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which invest in government bonds for you. Instead of being given a maturity date and being paid regular interest from the government, you will instead be given a regular income through dividends.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This of government bond ETFs as index-linked gilts. Much like how an ETF for the FTSE 100 would track the value of the FTSE and pay dividends accordingly, a government bond ETF works much the same as it tracks the value of the gilts instead of you directly investing in them. There are no coupon payments when you invest in government bonds through an ETF, and your bond doesn't expire, through you may have to pay management fees to the fund managers. These ETFs can be purchased through trading accounts, similar to individual bonds or shares.</p>

                    <p><b><u>Types of UK Government Bonds</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Standard UK Government bonds or gilts.</li>
                        <li>Conventional Gilts - with calls that allow the government to repay before the maturity date.</li>
                        <li>Index-Linked Gilts - coupon tracks RPI.</li>
                        <li>Undated or Prepetual Gilts.</li>
                        <li>Foreign Currency Bonds.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Why Invest in Government Bonds</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Even though they may seem similar to buying individual shares in a company, buying government bonds can be useful fixed-income securities that come with their own advantages.</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Since countries and their governments tend to be quite stable, government bonds are typically lower risk and could offer a stable, regular investment. After all, it would require the entire government to crash for you to lose your money.</li>
                        <li>That said, you should keep in mind that this can still happen. Take Greece's economic crash in late 2009, for example. Greece may have seemed like a stable country, but the government-debt crisis would have ruined the value of many government bonds. So, while unlikely, it's still possible.</li>
                        <li>Investing in government bonds could also be a great way to diversify your portfolio. Since they are linked to the government, if the market dips and the shares in your portfolio decrease in value, your investment in government bonds could remain stable.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>How is the Price of UK Bonds Calculated?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There are a few reasons why the bond price changes:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interest Rates.</li>
                        <li>Coupon Rates.</li>
                        <li>Maturity Times.</li>
                        <li>Credit Rating.</li>
                        <li>Inflation Rates.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Government Bonds vs Corporate Bonds</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Government bonds are quite different to corporate bonds. A corporate bond is when you are loaning money to a business instead of a government. This allows a company to raise funds for projects and may allow them to obtain more money than the banks will lend them. This is much like investing in shares of a company, though you can think of corporate bonds as interest-bearing shares.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You can hold your corporate bonds and receive interest until the maturity date, or you can try to sell it for a profit on a secondary market, forgoing the interest payments for an immediate return.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>You should keep in mind that prices and interest rates could fluctuate as the performance of a company could be less stable than a government, and the company could even fail entitely. As a result, corporate bonds could offer a higher-risk investment that has the potential for higher growth when compared to government bonds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>What are the Risks with Bonds?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Interest Rate Risk:</b> <i>as interest rates predominantly influence the price of a bond, these pose the biggest risks to bond traders. Rising interest would cause the bond market to fall in value. It is recommended that traders assess both the duration of a bond and its interest rate projections when looking to purchase or trade bonds.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Inflation Risk:</b> <i>inflation reudces the purchasing power on a bond's face value and any coupon payment. When inflation rises, it can cause interest rates to rise, in turn reducing the value of the bond. However, traders can opt for an interest-linked bond that increases in value with the rate of inflation.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Liquidity Risk:</b> <i>liek any market, liquidity can affect your ability to buy and sell bonds effectively. However, government bonds are less likely to carry liquidity risks when compared to corporate bonds. However, if liquidity risks are present, the seller may struggle to sell their bond at its expected price. Sellers may be forced to accept a lower-than-expected price, causing the market's value to fall.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Bonds and Quantitative Easing</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Quantitative Easing (EQ) is when central banks go into the financial markets and create new money to buy financial assets. Those assets are bonds, mainly government bonds. However, they can also be corporate bonds.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>How much is the Bond Market worth?</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Calculating a specific figure is not straightforward and it does change as markets move. The McKinsey Global Institute published some figures in 2011 which put the outstanding amount of bonds at more than $100 trillion (Â£73 trillion). About 40% of it was government bonds. The whole bond market ar the time was, according to these figures, worth about double the value of global shares.</p>
