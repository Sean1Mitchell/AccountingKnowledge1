                    <br>
                    <p>Analytical procedures are important at this stage of the audit process, just as they are at the planning and strategy stages. However, matters "surrounding" the financial statements for the period must also be taken into account, such as:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Opening balances and comparatives.</li>
                        <li>The publication of unaudited information.</li>
                        <li>Events after the balance sheet date.</li>
                        <li>The auditors' responsibility for going concern.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Compliance with Relevant Legislation</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Relevant Accounting Standards (FRS102)</li>
                        <li>Companies Act 2006</li>
                        <li>This ensures consistency of approach and comparability for other companies.</li>
                        <li>guidance from Financial Reporting Council is followed.</li>
                        <li>International Standards on Auditing are adhered to.</li>
                        <li>Auditor agrees that the financial statements meet all these standards.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Events after the Reporting Date</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Up to the Date of the Audit Report</b> - <i>auditors should perform procedures designed to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence that all events up to the date of the auditor's report that may require adjustment or disclosure have been identified.</i></li>
                        <li><b>After the Date of the Audit Report but before FS are issued</b> - <i>auditor has no responsibility to perform procedures or make enquiry regarding FS after the audit report date. If the auditor becomes aware of amendements, they should discuss with manangement and consider implications for the audit report.</i></li>
                        <li><b>After the FS are issued</b> - <i>auditor has no obligation to make any inquiry regarding FS. If new information relating to prior to the date of the auditor's report comes to light, auditor should consider revision of FS and discuss with management.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>The Concept of Going Concern</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>An entity prepares financial statements on a going concern basis when, under the going concern assumption, the entity is viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future. The term foreseeable future is not defined but IAS 1/FRS102 deem the foreseeable future to be a period of at least 12 months from the end of the reporting period.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The concept of going concern is an underlying assumption in the preparation of the financial statements, hence it is assumed that the entity has neither the intention, nor the need, to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If management conclude that the entity has no alternative but to liquidate or curtail materially the scale of its operations, the going concern basis cannot be used and the financial statements must be prepared on a different basis.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Indicators of Going Concern Problems</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Growth in the level of competition faced by the company.</li>
                        <li>Significant decline in demand for its products.</li>
                        <li>Failing to re-invest in new product development.</li>
                        <li>Loss of key staff/inability to recruit suitably experienced staff.</li>
                        <li>Inability or agree suitable financing terms with the bank.</li>
                        <li>Investment in long term assets with short term finance.</li>
                        <li>Delayed payments to suppliers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>The auditors' responsibility for going concern when planning and performing audit procedures, and in evaluating the results thereof, the auditor should consider the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>In Conclusions</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The fundamental principle is: when planning and performing the audit procedures and in evaluating the results, the auditor should consider the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern assumption in the preparation of the FS.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Management is required to make an assessment of the enterprise's ability to continue for the foreseeable future considering the following factors:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Financial:</b> <i>BS position, Budgeted negative cash flows, and maturing debts without realistic prospect of repayment.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Operating:</b> <i>Los of key managemenr without replacement, and loss of major market.</i></li>
                        <li><b>Other:</b> <i>Non-compliance with capital or other statutory requirements.</i></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors must review management's going concern assessment, gather sufficient appropriate evidence to confirm/dispel whether a material uncertainty exists and seek management representations regarding future plans. In carrying out evaluation, procedures should include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Analysing and discussing latest and budgeted financial information.</li>
                        <li>Reading board minutes for reference to financial difficulties and future plans.</li>
                        <li>Review loan agreement terms and determining whether there has been or will likely be any breach.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Management representation</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This standard was recently revised due, mainly, to concerns that auditors may be over-reliant on written representations. While written representations provide necessary audit evidence, they support other forms of evidence and do not on their own provide sufficient appropriate audit evidence.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The auditor must, however, obtain the following written representations about management's responsibilities:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>That they have fulfilled their responsibilities for the preparation of financial statements.</li>
                        <li>That they have provided the auditor with all relevant information and access to records, as agrred in the engagement terms; and</li>
                        <li>That all transactions have been recorded and reflected in the financial statements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>The Auditor's Report</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The objective of an auditor, in accordance with ISA 700 forming an opinion and reporting on financial statements are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>to form an opinion on the financial statements based upon an evaluation of their conclusions drawn from audit evidence; and</li>
                        <li>to express clearly that opinion through a written report.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Audition Opinion</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>An unqualified opinion should only be expressed when the auditor concludes that the financial statements give a true and fair view (or are presented fairly, in all material respects) in accordance with the identified financial reporting framework.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>The Unqualified Audit Opinion</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"In our opinion, the accompying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at year end date, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with relevant accounting standards".</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Emphasis of Matter</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>To highlight a material matter regarding a going concern problem, if there is significant uncertainty (other than a going concern problem) which may affect the financial statements on its future resolution, for example:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"Without qualifying our opinion we draw attention to Note X to the financial statements. The Company is the defendant in a lawsuit alleging infringement of certain patent rights and claiming royalities and punitive damages. The Company has filed a counter action, and preliminary hearings and discovery proceedings on both actions are in progress. The ultimate outcome of the matter cannot presently be determined, and no provision for any liability that may result has been made in the financial statements."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Modified Audit Opinions</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Disagreement</b> - Except for & Adverse Opinion</li>.
                        <li><b>Limitation of Scope</b> - Except for & Disclaimer of Opinion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><b><u>Disagreement - "Except for"</u></b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>"As discussed in Note X to the financial statements, no depreciation has been provided in the financial statements which practice, in our opinion, is not in accordance with Internation Accounting Standards. The provision for the year ended 31 December 31 XXXX, should be XXX based on the stright-line method of depreciation using annual rates of 5% for the building and 20% for the equipment. accordingly, the fixed assets should be reduced by accumulated depreciation of XXX and the loss for the year and accumulated deficit should be increased by XXX and XXX, respectively."</p>
                    <br>

                    <p>In our opinion, becuase of the effects of the matters discussed in the preceding paragraph(s), the financial statements do not give a true and fair view of (or do not 'present fairly') the financial position of the Company as of December 31, XXXX, and of the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended then in accordance with International Accounting Standards."</p>
                    <br>
