                    <h1>Overhead Absorption</h1>
                    <p>Overhead absorption is the process of absorbing the indirect costs of the business into each unit/service that is provided. Meaning, when a company complies it’s cost statement (in order to determine selling price, cost of a unit/service etc), they consist of direct and indirect costs – direct being those costs directly contributed to the production of the product/service, and indirect being those costs that have nothing to do with the actual production itself, but more so, the costs of the company.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="content-box">
                    <p>Within a Cost Statement, we'd have;</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Material + Labour = Prime Cost + Overheads = Total Cost + Profit Margin = Selling Price.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now, in theory this is sound, but in reality we’re increasing the amount customers pay for the product/service, which may actually deter customers from buying, and going to competitors instead. Therefore, we want to ensure that we are absorbing overheads as efficiently as possible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Previously, the go to for absorption was the Traditional Method, which is where we allocate based on a single volume-based cost driver – typically direct labour hours, or machine hours. However, this proved to be ineffective because we would be absorbing costs onto products that did not utilise as much resources as other products, meaning they would be sold for higher prices than others.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>More often than not, we see businesses adopting the more accurate and effective means of absorption, which is Activity Based Costing (ABC). This is where we allocate based on multiple activities that drive costs, usually activity-specific cost drivers.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>let's go over an exercise to further exlore the workings of Overhead Absorption</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Before we start, please head to <a href="https://github.com/Sean1Mitchell/AccountingKnowledge1/tree/main/Exercises">Exercise</a>, and download the Excel that I have already completed (once there, click "view raw" - this will download it). Here you'll be able to see it as I did. This makes it easier to follow along as I give the reasons why we take what we do, and why we do the calculations that we do.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Let's assume we have the following data to work with:</p>

                    <p>Using this data, we're going to explore both Traditional, and Absorption Method of overhead absorption.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Traditional Method</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The traditional method is the simplest method, where we take the total indirect expenses of the company and using either machine hours, or direct labour hours to determine the OAR (Overhead Absorption Rate). We then take the OAR and multiply by the machine or direct labour hours, which then gives us the overhead charge per unit – which is added to the cost statement for pricing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Step 1:</b> If we absorbed based on direct labour hours, we would multiply the level of production per product by the labour hours per product - we then divide the £1.7 million by the total amount - this gives us the OAR:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A: 40,000 * 3 = 120,000</p>
                    <p>B: 25,000 * 4 = 100,000</p>
                    <p>C: 10,000 * 2 = 20,000</p>
                    <p>(120,000 + 100,000 + 20,000 = 240,000).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then,</p>
                    <p>1,700,000 / 240,000 = 7.08 OAR</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Step 2:</b> We then take the OAR and multiply by the direct labour hour per product;</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A: 7.08 * 3 = 21.25</p>
                    <p>B: 7.08 * 4 = 28.33</p>
                    <p>C: 7.08 * 2 = 14.17</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Therefore, these figures are the overheads attached to the cost statement for pricing per product, as seen below:</p>

                    <p><b>Activity Based Costing</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The activity based method is far more complex, but immensely more accurate.  Instead of being driven by direct labour hours or machine hours and production volume, they are driven by specific cost generators, known as Cost Drivers. To determine OAR (which is different per product for activity based method), we first need to cross-reference both data that we have, and the overhead (activity). For example, Set-Up Costs are influenced by the Number of Production Runs.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Using the activity overhead cost and cost driver, we can look at cost driver units and cost per cost driver. The cost driver units will be the cost driver for every product added together, in the example of no. Production runs, it would be the data of: (5 + 10 + 25) = 40. And the cost per cost driver would be the total cost divided by cost driver units. And lastly, we want to multiply the cost per cost drivers and multiply by the proportion of cost driver that comes from each product respectively.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Again, using the same data:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Step 1:</b> Using the examples of activities that we have: Set-up costs, machine costs, goods inwards, packaging, and engineering. We look at the cost driver that would influence it’s total cost. Therefore, we have the following pairs:</p>
