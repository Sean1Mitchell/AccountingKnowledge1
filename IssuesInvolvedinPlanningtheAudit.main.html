                    <h2>The Audit Year</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Interim</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The interim typically occurs partway through the financial year, usually six months before the final audit. The auditor elected by the board of directors at the annual general meeting will review internal controls, perform analytical procedures, and test transactions from start of the year until the period they are at. The purpose of this is to identify risks early while reducing the pressure at year-end, and to improve the efficiency of the final audit.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Stock-Take/Inventory Check</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>At the end of the financial year, a physical inventory count is done, however, sometimes this is done at interim points too. If an external audit is required, auditors may observe the stock-take to ensure that it’s carried out correctly and that the valuation method aligns with relevant accounting standards. Companies that use perpetual inventory systems may choose to still perform periodic checks to ensure accuracy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Final Audit</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The final audit takes place after the financial year ends and when the full financial statements are prepared. This process involves verifying transactions, assessing year-end adjustments – like accruals and prepayments, and confirming the asset valuations. The auditors duty is to prepare a report based on their opinion, typically in the form of an audit report, stating whether they believe the financial statements give a “true and fair view”.</p>

                    <h2>Auditing Staff</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Partner</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The most senior member of the audit team is the ‘Partner’, and is responsible for signing off the audit report. This ensures that the audit complies with UK auditing standards (ISA UK) and regulatory requirements. They also review key audit findings and communicate with the client’s board of directors or audit committee.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Directors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Firms that are large tend to have directors who handle complex audits, review key judgements, and act as a final reviewer for other auditors before they sign the work off to the partner. Unlike partners, directors may not have any ownership in the firm.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Managers</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The next on the list is the ‘Managers, and is responsible for overseeing the audit process and ensures deadlines, and quality standards are met. They act as the main point of contact between the audit firm and the client’s senior management team. Additionally, they review work done by supervisors and trainees before it goes to the partner. They ensure to allocate tasks within the audit team to make sure resources are used effectively.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Supervisors</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Audit supervisors act as a bridge between trainees and managers in the hierarchy of auditing staff. They typically assist in the planning of audits, reviewing work completed by trainee auditors, and resolve potential technical issues.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Trainee (or equvialent terms)</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Trainees are entry-level auditors completing their professional qualification. They typically carry out basic audit procedures like checking financial records, testing controls, and documenting findings. They are usually trained/given guidance until they have passed their professional qualification by their supervisors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Others</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Other audit staff members include forensic accountants who investigate fraud and litigation support, or technical specialists who provide areas in, for example, IFRS, tax, or data analytics. And we have IT auditors, who are more focused on technology and cyber risks in financial reporting.</p>

                    <h2>Use of Organisational Charts for Knowledge of Business and it's staff</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisation charts are visual representations of a company’s structure, showing hierarchical relationships, reporting lines, and key personnel. In auditing, these charts help auditors gain an understanding of the business and its staff, which is crucial for assessing risk, internal controls, and fraud detection.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Understanding the Business Structure</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>By having charts, auditors are better able to:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Identify Key Decision-Makers</b> - who holds authority in financial reporting and operations?</li>
                        <li><b>Recognise Reporting Lines</b> - how responsibilities flow within the organisation.</li>
                        <li><b>Assess Decentralisation vs. Centralisation</b> - is financial control spread out or centralised?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, in a multinational company, an organisation chart can reveal whether financial oversight is managed centrally or delegated to regional offices.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Assessing Internal Control Responsibilities</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts help in evaluating the effectiveness of internal controls by:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Identify Key Control Roles</b> - who is responsible for authorising transactions and approving financial statements?</li>
                        <li><b>Spotting Segregation of Duties Issues</b> - are conflicting roles assigned to the same person, or with someone of relation (family)?</li>
                        <li><b>Assessing Risk of Management Override</b> - if all financial control is concentrated in a few hands, the risk of fraud increases.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, the Head of Finance also oversees internal audits, this could be a red flag for independence issues.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Fraud Risk Assessment and Related Parties</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts help auditors:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Detect Conflicts of Interest</b> - are there undisclosed relationships between key personnel?</li>
                        <li><b>Identify Related Parties</b> - are key individuals in positions to influence transactions with related entities?</li>
                        <li><b>Assess Management's Influence</b> - if one person has excessive control, they could manipulate financial reporting.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for example, if a company's CEO and procurement manager are related, the auditor may need to investigate potential self-dealing or procurement fraud.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>Planning the Audit and communication</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditor's use Organisational Charts to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Determine Who to Interview</b> - identify key personnel for inquiries on controls and financial reporting.</li>
                        <li><b>Plan Audit Procedures</b> - understand which departments handles key financial processes.</li>
                        <li><b>Coordinate with Internal Audit & Compliance</b> - ensure alignment with the company's internal risk management.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>for instance, if payroll errors are identified, the auditor can quickly pinpoint which department and personnel oversee payroll processing.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><b>In Conclusion</b></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Organisational charts are essential in audit planning and risk assessment. They provide insights into:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The structure and key personnel of a business</li>
                        <li>The effectiveness of internal controls and segregation of duties.</li>
                        <li>The potential for fraud, conflicts of interest, and management override.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Assessments</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Inherit Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk of a material misstatement ocurring in the financial statements due to the nature of the business or its transactions, before considering internal controls.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Inherit Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Quality of Internal Controls</b> - for example, high-tech companies with complex revenue recognition.</li>
                        <li><b>Complex Transactions</b> - for example, derivatives, mergers, or acquisitions.</li>
                        <li><b>High Level of Estimation and Judgement</b> - for example, asset valuations, provisions.</li>
                        <li><b>Rapid Business Growth or Significant Changes in Operations.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Past Fraud or History of Errors in Financial Statements.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>Auditors assess inherit risk at both the financial statements level (risk of fraud) and the accounts (risk of accounts like revenue or inventory).</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Control Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk that a material misstatement will not be prevented, detected, or corrected by the client's internal controls.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Control Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Quality of Internal Controls</b> - for example, segragation of duties, IT controls.</li>
                        <li><b>Management's Attitude towards Internal Controls and Fraud Prevention.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Complexity of the Organisation's Financial Reporting Processes.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Weakness in Prior Internal or External Audits.</b></li>
                        <li><b>Deficiencies in the Company's Governance and Oversight.</b></li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Detection Risk</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the risk that auditor's procedures do not detect a material misstatement that exists in the financial statements.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Factors affecting Detection Risk:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is influenced by the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures.</li>
                        <li>It is inversely related to substantive testing - if inheret and control risks are high, auditors reduce detection risk by increasing the extent of testing.</li>
                        <li>It can arise due to human error, poor audit planning, sampling limitations, or the complexity of financial statements.</li>
                        <li>Auditors manage detection risk by improving audit procedures, using professional scepticism, and applying technology and data analytics where appropriate.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Audit and Assurance Council's Definition of Materiality</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>The definition is: “Misstatements, including omissions, are considered to be material if they, individually or in aggregate, could reasonably to be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.”.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Key Aspect of Maturity are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>User-Oriented:</b> where materiality is assessed based on the potential impact on the user of financial statements (investors, creditors, regulators).</li>
                        <li><b>Quantitative and Qualitative Factors:</b> where quantitative is often a percentage of benchmarks such as profit before tax, revenue, total assets, or equity. And where qualitative is even small misstatements where they can be material if they affect compliance with laws, debt covenants, or management integrity.</li>
                        <li><b>Context-Specific:</b> where materiality depends on the nature and circumstances of the business and financial statements.</li>
                        <li><b>Applied Throughout the Audiy:</b> where auditors determine materiality at the planning stage and reassess it as the audit progresses.</li>

                    <h2>General Controls and Application Controls</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>For auditing, there are IT systems built for auditing, and these are referred to as General and Application Controls. They help in ensuring the reliability and accuracy of financial reporting and compliance with regulations. They are as follows:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>General Controls</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These are broad, overarching controls that apply to the IT environment as a whole. They help ensure the reliability, security, and integrity of systems used in financial reporting. For example:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Access Control</b> - restricting access to authorised users only.</li>
                        <li><b>Change Management Controls</b> - ensures proper authorisation and testing before the system changes or updates.</li>
                        <li><b>Backups and Recovery Procedures</b> - regular backups, disaster recover planning, and testing.</li>
                        <li><b>IT Security Policies</b> - establishing policies on data protection, cybersecurity, and IT governance.</li>
                        <li><b>Software Development Controls</b> - ensures new systems or updates are tested before implementation.</li>
                        <li><b>Physical Security Controls</b> - restricting access to data centres or servers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>These controls reduce the risl of unauthorised access, system failuresm or data corruption that could impact financial reporting.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><u><b>Application Controls</b></u></p>
                    <br>
                    <p>These are controls specific to individual software applications used in financial processing (accounting software, payroll systems, ERP systems). They help ensure accuracy, completeness, and validity of data within applications. For example:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Input Controls</b> - validations to prevent incorrect data entry (required fields, format checks).</li>
                        <li><b>Processing Controls</b> - ensuring correct processing of transactions (reconciliation, system calculations).</li>
                        <li><b>Output Controls</b> - ensuring reports and financial statements are accurate and complete.</li>
                        <li><b>Integrity Checks</b> - vertification of data accuracy across different systems (audit trails, cross-checking balances).</li>
                        <li><b>Authorisation Controls</b> - ensuring only authorised personnel can approve transactions (manager approvals for payment).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>These controls focus on data accuracy and validity within a specific system rather then the IT environment as a whole.</p>
